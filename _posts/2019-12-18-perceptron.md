# H1 Heading

## H2 Heading

### H3 Heading

This is the basic text.

Some *italics*

Here's some **bold**

How about  a [link](https://github.com/)

Here are some bulleted list:
  * Uno
  + Dos
  - Tres

Here are some numbered lists:
1. Uno
2. Dos
3. Tres

Python code block:
'''python
import numpy as np

def sum_func(x, y):
  z = np.sum(x, y)
  return z
'''

R code block:
'''r
library(tidyverse)
df <- read_csv("some_file.csv")
head(df)
'''

Here's some of the inline code 'X+y'.

Here's an image below with HTML:
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}//images/DL.png" alt="Deeplearning curve">

Here's how to do it with Kramdown:
![alt]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/DL.png)

Here's how you put math functions:
 $$ z= x+y $$
